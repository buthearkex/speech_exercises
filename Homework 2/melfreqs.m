function [ edges ] = melfreqs( fmin, fmax, k )
%MELFREQS Returns k+2 points in linear scale that are equally spaced on 
% mel-scale

%   Function computes k+2 points in the linear frequency domain that are
%   equally spaced on the mel- scale. fmin and fmax are the lowest 
%   and respectively highest frequency in the signal. k corresponds to the
%   number of auditory critical bands, i.e., 24.


%% Calculate equally spaced points on mel-scale


%% Converts mel-scale points to linear scale
