% Let's read the audio file.
% y includes the samples, while Fs is the sample rate
[y, Fs] = audioread('13ZZ637A.wav');

% Let's calculate samples 100 ms
nbr_samples_in_hundred_ms = Fs * 0.1;

% Let's calculate ACF
autocorrelated_signal = autocorrelation(y,nbr_samples_in_hundred_ms);

% Let's plot the autocorreltaed signal
figure();
x1 = linspace(0,0.1,nbr_samples_in_hundred_ms);
plot(x1,autocorrelated_signal');
xlabel('Ï„ in seconds');
ylabel('r_ss');
title('ACF');

% The fundamental frequency can be seen from the second maximum, which
% indicates the period of the fundamental frequency. Visually the second
% maximum is approximately at 0.008 seconds, which would mean that the
% fundmental frequency would be 122 Hz.

% Let's draw the graph with the maxima marked.
% We use 0.007 seconds as minPeakDistance, since it correlates to around
% 140Hz, which is close to the upper limit of the fundamental frequency of
% the male voice.
findpeaks(autocorrelated_signal,x1,'MinPeakDistance',0.007);

% calculate the average 
[peak,location] = findpeaks(autocorrelated_signal,x1,'MinPeakDistance',0.007);
meanPeriod = mean(diff(location));

meanFre = round(1/meanPeriod);
fprintf('The mean fundamental frequency is %d Hz', meanFre);

% The mean fundamental frequency is around 122 Hz, so it is a male voice.
